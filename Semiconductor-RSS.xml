Leak Suggests Hygon C86 Could Hit 3.0 GHz Boost and 95 W TDP, Making it a True-Efficiency+Performance x86 Contender The last time we looked at the Chinese-made Hygon C86 series, it appeared inside the Thunderobot gaming PCs. The report showcased performance numbers that matched Intel Raptor Lake&apos;s Core i7 SKUs in multi-threaded benchmarks. Despite weaker single-threaded results, the chip demonstrated China&apos;s domestic x86 designs that are evolving quite fast enough to compete with recent processor […]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read full article at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wccftech.com/16-core-hygon-c86-cpu-reportedly-boasts-3-0-ghz-boost-clock-and-95-tdp/&quot;&gt;https://wccftech.com/16-core-hygon-c86-cpu-reportedly-boasts-3-0-ghz-boost-clock-and-95-tdp/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
