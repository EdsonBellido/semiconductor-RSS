Seeing as how the region is the forefront for next-generation lithography, the Arizona plant in the U.S. that has employed hundreds of engineers cannot progress without additional training. According to a new report, these individuals are being sent overseas to learn the ins and outs of 3nm and 2nm production, which will later give the Arizona plant a significant edge in securing chip orders. In 2021, the U.S. had […]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read full article at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wccftech.com/tsmc-arizona-plant-sending-engineers-to-taiwan-to-learn-3nm-and-2nm-production/&quot;&gt;https://wccftech.com/tsmc-arizona-plant-sending-engineers-to-taiwan-to-learn-3nm-and-2nm-production/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
