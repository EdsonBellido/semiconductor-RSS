      <title>Reconfigurable platform slows lights for on-chip photonic engineering</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2025-12-reconfigurable-platform-chip-photonic.html</link>
      <description>Integrated circuits are the brains behind modern electronic devices like computers or smart phones. Traditionally, these circuits—also known as chips—rely on electricity to process data. In recent years, scientists have turned their attention to photonic chips, which perform similar tasks using light instead of electricity to improve speed and energy efficiency.</description>
